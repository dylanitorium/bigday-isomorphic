Accounts and Users
----------------
As a `User` I can login with Google or Facebook.

As a `User` on my first login I want to create an `Account` as the `Owner`.

As a `User` I can add `Guests` to my `Account`.

As an `Owner` I can add `Users` to my account.

As a `User` I can see a dashboard with the total number of `Guests`

As a `User` I can generate an API Key so third party apps can interface with my `Guest` list.
